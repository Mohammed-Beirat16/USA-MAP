This Java-based project implements graph-based algorithms to model and analyze networks of cities and roads. Using core data structures like Vertex, Edge, City, and MinHeap,
the application computes optimal paths or connectivity across a custom-defined graph structure.

Key Features:
Object-Oriented graph modeling with cities as nodes and roads as weighted edges.

Efficient shortest path computation using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

Utilizes custom-built MinHeap for priority queue operations.

Classes such as Graph, Driver, and ItemDefault support modular code organization.

Suitable for educational use in data structures, algorithms, and geographic systems.
